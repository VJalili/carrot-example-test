# carrot-example-test
This repository contains an example test to be used as reference for designing tests when using [CARROT](https://github.com/broadinstitute/carrot) and the [CARROT CLI](https://github.com/broadinstitute/carrot_cli).

## What's in this repository?
### The example application
The example test uses a simple [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) application with two commands:

`example-test make-data [a] [b]` prints 20 x,y coordinate pairs for values of x in the range [0,2] in increments of 0.1 supplied to the function `y = ab^x`

`example-test compare [file]` accepts a csv file containing output from `make-data` and prints prints 20 x,y coordinate pairs for values of x in the range [0,2] in increments of 0.1, where `y = |2^x - file(x)|` where file(x) is the y value paired with x within the file.

### The test config
The `carrot-test-config` directory contains a file called `carrot_commands.txt` which lists the series of CARROT CLI commands to use to prepare and run the example test, along with all the necessary files to do so.

## Using this repository
First, ensure you have access to a running [CARROT](https://github.com/broadinstitute/carrot) server with software building functionality and reporting functionality configured, and that you have downloaded and installed the [CARROT CLI](https://github.com/broadinstitute/carrot_cli) and configured it to point to that server.

Then, download the contents of carrot-test-config and run the commands in the `carrot_commands.txt` file using CARROT CLI, following the instructions in the comments.  Make sure you are using the version of this repository that is compatible with the version of CARROT that you are running.  The branch names and release names in this repository match version numbers for releases of CARROT.  If there is not a release or branch of this repository that matches the version of CARROT you are using, use Price is Right rules to determine which version to use: pick the branch of this repository with a version number that is closest to your CARROT version without exceeding it.
